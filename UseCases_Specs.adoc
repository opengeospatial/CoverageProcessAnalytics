== Use Cases and API specs

Coverages span regular and irregular grids, point clouds, and meshes (i.e., curve, surface and solid bundles).
For the purpose of this sprint, only gridded ("raster") coverages and point clouds (in coverage terminology: multi-point coverages) are addressed, not meshes (in coverage terminology: multi-curve/surface/solid coverages). The reason is that grids and point clouds are common use cases that receive the most attention today. However, other kinds of datasets are not excluded per se (and may be addressed in future).

ISSUE: the enumeration below jumps from arrays to point clouds to arrays. Should be sorted.

1. Raster/Grid/Array no interpolation
2. Multi-point Coverages - non-uniform
3. Analytics including interpolation

=== 1. Raster/Grid/Array

ISSUE: what is subselecting?

* Data - 2D Grid
** Domain: Uniform distribution in a CRS
** Range type: scalar, vector (no tensors)
* Operations
** subsetting, subselecting (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, lon, time
** calculation Avg and NDVI (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, lon, time
* API Coverages and API Processing?

== 2. Multi-point Coverages
* Data model
** Domain: Non-uniform data distribution
** Range types: scalar, vector (no tensors)
* Operations
** Subset by lat, lon, time
** Interpolation
* API Coverages and API Processing
* Applications
** Weather station data
** Earth Observation LIDAR

== 3. Analytics
* API Coverages and API Processes
* Data
** flat (projection)
** curved (geographic)
* Functions including interpolation
** list of functions TBD - see below


Draft candidates for atomic pieces (also need use cases) - make comments.

ISSUE: what data and services will be available for experimentation?

complexity:
- bbox access
- in native CRS
- in non-native CRS
- single-pixel operations (Tomlin's "local operations", ex: NDVI)
- aggregation (ex: min/max NDVI)
- neighbourhood operations (Tomlin's "focal operations", ex: Sobel filter)
- global operations (Tomlin's "global operations")
- simple (ex: matrix multiplication)
- complex (ex: ML, such as linear regression)
- data fusion (ex: average NDVI where temperature is above threshold)

dimensions:
- analytics in x/y (flat image)
- analytics in x/y/t (image timeseries)
- analytics in x/y/z (volumetric)
- analytics in x/y/z/t (fully spatio-temporal, ex: climate)

scalability:
- single node, data size fits into server RAM
- single node, data size exceeds RAM
- multiple local nodes (cloud)
- geographically disparate nodes (federation)

standards:
- no OGC W*S support
- OGC WMS standard
- OGC WCS standard
- OGC WCPS standard
- OGC OAPI - Coverages draft



== API Specifications

Aim of use cases, implementations and testing is to update these draft OGC API specs:
