== Use Cases and API specs
1. Raster/Grid/Array no interpolation
2. Multi-point Coverages - non-uniform
3. Analytics including interpolation

Only gridded/rasters coverages and multi-point coverages are addressed, not Curve/Surface/SolidCoverages. The reason is that these are common use cases that receive the most attention today.  Gridded coverages or 'point-cloud' multi-point coverages are the primary data types considered but other kinds of datasets are not excluded.


=== 1. Raster/Grid/Array
* Data - 2D Grid
** uniform in a CRS
*** flat (projection) - primary
*** curved (geographic)
** Range Record: single value, vector (no tensors)
* operations
** subsetting, subselecting (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, long, time
*** API Coverages
** calculation Avg and NDVI (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, long, time
*** API Coverages and? API Processing?

== 2. multi-point coverages
* non-uniform data distribution in the range
* Range Record: single value, vector (no tensors)
* subset by lat, lon, time
** API coverages

== 3. Analytics
* API Coverages and API Processes
* Data
** flat (projection)
** curved (geographic)
* Functions including interpolation
** regridding?

== API Specifications

Aim of use cases, implementations and testing is to update these draft OGC API specs:
