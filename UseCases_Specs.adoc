== Use Cases and API specs
1. Raster/Grid/Array no interpolation
2. Multi-point Coverages - non-uniform
3. Analytics including interpolation

Only gridded/rasters coverages and multi-point coverages are addressed, not Curve/Surface/SolidCoverages. The reason is that these are common use cases that receive the most attention today.  Gridded coverages or 'point-cloud' multi-point coverages are the primary data types considered but other kinds of datasets are not excluded.


=== 1. Raster/Grid/Array
* Data - 2D Grid
** Domain: Uniform distribution in a CRS
** Range type: scalar, vector (no tensors)
* Operations
** subsetting, subselecting (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, lon, time
** calculation Avg and NDVI (no interpolation)
*** i,j,k
*** lat, lon, time
* API Coverages and API Processing?

== 2. Multi-point Coverages
* Data model
** Domain: Non-uniform data distribution
** Range types: scalar, vector (no tensors)
* Operations
** Subset by lat, lon, time
** Interpolation
* API Coverages and API Processing
* Applications
** Weather station data
** Earth Observation LIDAR

== 3. Analytics
* API Coverages and API Processes
* Data
** flat (projection)
** curved (geographic)
* Functions including interpolation
** list of functions TBD - see below


Draft candidates for atomic pieces (also need use cases) - make comments.

complexity:
- bbox access
- in native CRS
- in non-native CRS
- single-pixel operations (Tomlin's "local operations", ex: NDVI)
- aggregation (ex: min/max NDVI)
- neighbourhood operations (Tomlin's "focal operations", ex: Sobel filter)
- global operations (Tomlin's "global operations")
- simple (ex: matrix multiplication)
- complex (ex: ML, such as linear regression)
- data fusion (ex: average NDVI where temperature is above threshold)

dimensions:
- analytics in x/y (flat image)
- analytics in x/y/t (image timeseries)
- analytics in x/y/z (volumetric)
- analytics in x/y/z/t (fully spatio-temporal, ex: climate)

scalability:
- single node, data size fits into server RAM
- single node, data size exceeds RAM
- multiple local nodes (cloud)
- geographically disparate nodes (federation)

standards:
- no OGC W*S support
- OGC WMS standard
- OGC WCS standard
- OGC WCPS standard
- OGC OAPI - Coverages draft



== API Specifications

Aim of use cases, implementations and testing is to update these draft OGC API specs:
